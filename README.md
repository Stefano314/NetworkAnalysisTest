# NetworkAnalysisTest
This is a test of a simple network generation/visualization and uploading everything on github using Git.

#================================================================================

In order to execute the file you need to install the following libraries:
- numpy (I used anaconda package manager ==> conda install numpy)
- networkX ==> conda install networkx
- pyvis (This one is not available on conda, so I used pip ==> pip install pyvis)

#================================================================================

The network visualization is in html, so it is interactable too.
